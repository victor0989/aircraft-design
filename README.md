Aircraft design with python, c++ and modeling with modelica templates

The Systems for Green Operations ITD of Clean Sky aims to demonstrate substantial environmental and economic benefits of more electric aircraft systems technologies.
However, the design and validation of such highly integrated systems needs more co-operative and collaborative development processes involving aircraft, engine, and equipment manufacturers.
At the current state-of-the-art it is often the case that each application area uses different design and modeling tools, which cannot easily communicate and connect to each other for total system design and validation.
