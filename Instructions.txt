The Aircraft library is a versatile Modelica library for modeling and simulating aircraft dynamics
applications. It is structured into a number of sublibraries, that contain models for describing the
aerodynamics, atmosphere aerodynamic impact on aircraft, bodies, engine models, coordinate
transformation models. There are 50 component classes for modeling and simulating an aircraft in various configurations.
